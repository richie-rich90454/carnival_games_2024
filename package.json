The price per game is 1 or 2 tokens per game; the 2 token version offering a higher jackpot rate. The minimum rounds of games you could get per purchase per game is 5, and the maximum is 20; the 20 round version has a doubled jackpot rate. There are 2 games you could play in this program: number mode and not slot mode. Both have similar payout rate; the number mode is focused more on skill while the not slot mode is focused more on chance, and the number mode has slightly altered payout rates according to the game generated random number. Tokens are interusable through the 2 games. After playing all rounds purchased, there would be a end page with your prizes listed, and you could continue playing the game by clicking the \"Continue Playing\" button.\r     With no more to say, enjoy!",
